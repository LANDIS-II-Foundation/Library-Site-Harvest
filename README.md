# Site Harvest Library

This library is one of the Harvest Libraries. It provides functionality for selecting and cutting whole cohorts at individual sites on the landscape.  Selection is based on cohort ages.

Changes to this library are governed by the [**Repository Rules**](https://sites.google.com/site/landismodel/developers/developers-blog/repositoryrulesfromthetechnicaladvisorycommittee) from the Technical Advisory Committee.

Eric Gustafson is the custodian of this library as it is a component of the harvest extensions.
